# Text Classification using BERT
 Using Bert to perform taks of detection similar texts and text classification

# Libraries

* Numpy

* Pandas

* Pytorch

# RESULTS

Fine-Tuning Bert via Custom Neural Network (using nn.Module) led to much greated results than without Bert fine-tuning

I have reached WA-accuracy of 82% (with 6 classes)

I could have reached more if:

1) Used larger Bert and not tiny Bert (due to restrcitions on RAM in Google Colab)

2) Run more epoches
